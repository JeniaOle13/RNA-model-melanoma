# Transcriptomic Response of a Model Melanoma to Probiotic Bacteria

## Overview

This repository contains the complete analytical workflow and results for our investigation *Bifidobacterium adolescentis* 150 and *Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus* K32 influence gene expression patterns in a murine melanoma  B16-F1 using bulk RNA-seq.

## Key Findings

-   Identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) following probiotic treatment.
-   Characterization of immune-related pathways modulated by probiotics.
-   Comparative analysis of transcriptional profiles between treatment groups.
-   Potential mechanisms of probiotic-mediated anti- or pro-tumor effects.
